# Beigs\_Webpage

Hey\! This is a simple webpage project I built to practice and improve my HTML and CSS skills. It's a clean, minimal landing page design that I used to experiment with layout and positioning techniques.

This project is part of my journey to get better at front-end development, and I had a lot of fun putting it together.

## What I Learned & Implemented üë®‚Äçüíª

My main goal was to move beyond basic layouts and try something a bit more dynamic. Here are the key CSS concepts I focused on:

  * **CSS Flexbox:** I used `display: flex` and `justify-content: space-between` to build the navigation bar and the links at the bottom. It's a powerful tool for aligning items, and I'm getting more comfortable using it to create clean, spaced-out layouts.

  * **Absolute Positioning:** This was the most interesting part for me\! I used `position: absolute` along with `top` and `left` properties to manually place and overlap the three images. It helped me understand how to break elements out of the normal document flow to create a more custom, collage-style look.

  * **Basic Styling:** I also practiced my fundamentals by styling the text, setting up a basic CSS reset with `box-sizing: border-box` for consistency, and using margins and padding to control the spacing of the entire page.

## Future Goals üöÄ

I'm happy with how this turned out, but there's always more to do\! My next step for this project would be to:

1.  Make it fully responsive for mobile devices.
2.  Add some simple CSS animations or hover effects to make it more interactive.
